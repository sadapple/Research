## This script tries to implement the LPD proposed by Tony Cai
## the fastclime package
install.packages("fastclime")
library(fastclime)
# Load the package
L = fastclime.generator(n=200,d=50,graph="hub")
# Generate data with hub structures
out = fastclime(L$data,0.1)
# Estimate the solution path
plot(out)
# Plot the sparsity level information from the graph path
out1 = fastclime.lambda(out$lambdamtx, out$icovlist, 0.2)
# Finds the estimated path corrsponding to lambda=0.2
